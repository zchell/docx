"The project works perfectly here in Replit, but when I deploy to Vercel, the static preview doesn't work correctly. Please help me configure the project specifically for Vercel deployment by:

First, let's diagnose the Vercel build issue:

Run npm run build locally to see the dist folder structure

Check what's different between Replit's serving and Vercel's static hosting

Fix Vercel-specific configuration in vite.config.js:

js
export default {
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    assetsDir: 'assets',
    // Add this for Vercel SPA support
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        main: './index.html'
      }
    }
  },
  // Critical for Vercel - use absolute paths
  base: '/',
  // Ensure proper public path handling
  publicDir: 'public',
  server: {
    port: 3000
  }
}
Create a proper vercel.json for SPA routing:

json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/assets/(.*)",
      "headers": {
        "cache-control": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
      }
    }
  ],
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
Check if we need client-side routing fixes:

If using Vue Router/React Router, ensure it's configured for static hosting

Add a 404.html fallback for client-side routing

Test the Vercel build locally:

Serve the dist folder with a static server: npx serve dist -s

Check if all routes work correctly

The goal is to make the Vercel deployment match what works perfectly in Replit!"

Key differences to address:
Replit uses dynamic serving vs Vercel uses static file hosting

Path resolution might be different

Routing needs special handling for SPAs on static hosts

This should help the agent understand that we need Vercel-specific fixes while preserving the working Replit setup!
