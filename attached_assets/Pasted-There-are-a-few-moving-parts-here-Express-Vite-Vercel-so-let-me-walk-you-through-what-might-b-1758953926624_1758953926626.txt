There are a few moving parts here (Express + Vite + Vercel), so let me walk you through what might be going wrong and suggest fixes. If you can share your repo structure, vercel.json, or build logs, I can pinpoint more precisely, but here are general debugging steps and solutions.

Common issues & root causes
1. “No entrypoint found … dist” on Vercel

This usually means Vercel can’t detect what file to run (or where the built code is). It expects a serverless function entrypoint (or “framework”) but doesn’t find one that matches.

Vercel now supports Express natively (zero‑configuration) by simply having an export default app in your Express file.

But if you set up vercel.json with custom builds/routes, your configuration may override the default detection, and if it points to a file that doesn’t exist (e.g. dist/index.js), you’ll see “No entrypoint found.”

Also, Vercel by default expects server code (functions) under certain directories or with certain file patterns (e.g. api/*) unless overridden.

2. Vite deployed on Vercel but “auto download” or some functionality not working / content missing

If your Vite app is a static build (i.e. produces HTML + assets in dist), then any server logic (e.g. “automatic download” endpoints) must be implemented via Vercel Functions (or Express as a function). You can’t rely on a traditional Node server on Vercel like on your own server.

Sometimes static routes beyond / (e.g. /download/file, or nested routes) break unless you provide rewrites so those requests are served via your server or function. For SPAs, to avoid 404 on refresh, you often set a rewrite so every unknown route goes to index.html.

If parts of your app expect runtime Express behavior (e.g. express.static()) that Vercel does not support inside Express (serving static assets must go through public/**) you might lose functionality. In fact, Vercel’s Express support states: express.static() is ignored; static assets must live in public/**.

Proposed fixes & a sample setup

Here’s a recommended approach you can use (or adapt) to make Express + Vite work on Vercel:

Structure (example)
/api            ← for server (Express) code as serverless function
  index.js      ← the entrypoint for Express (export default app)
frontend/        ← your Vite project
  src/
  public/
  vite.config.js
  package.json
vercel.json

Express (in /api/index.js)
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

// e.g. route to handle file download
app.get('/download/:file', (req, res) => {
  // send file, etc.
});

// Optionally serve API routes
app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ msg: "Hello from Express" });
});

export default app;


Note: export default app is crucial so Vercel recognizes it as a serverless function.

It’s okay to have public/ static files in the top-level or your Vite public folder; Express’s static won’t serve them on Vercel. You should rely on the static build from Vite for frontend assets.

Vite build & config

In your Vite project’s package.json, have:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}


Make sure vite is in dependencies (so it’s available during build on Vercel) or that your build environment can install devDependencies. Some have failed because vite was only a dev dependency and not available in build environment on Vercel.

In vercel.json, set:

{
  "version": 3,
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/index.js" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/frontend/dist/$1" }
  ],
  "builds": [
    { "src": "api/index.js", "use": "@vercel/node" },
    { "src": "frontend/package.json", "use": "@vercel/static-build", "config": { "distDir": "frontend/dist" } }
  ]
}


The first build rule turns your Express server into a serverless function.

The second builds your Vite frontend as a static site.

The route /api/* is proxied to the Express function. Everything else (frontend) is served statically.

You may also need a fallback rewrite: { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/frontend/dist/index.html" } for SPA behavior (so refresh on subroutes works).

Validate locally & logs

Run npm run build (or appropriate build) locally and inspect the output directories. Make sure frontend/dist is produced and contains your built frontend.

Inspect that api/index.js exists after build (if you compile).

Deploy to Vercel and check build logs: which files got built, whether they appear in the “Output” file list in the Vercel dashboard.

If you see “No entrypoint found,” examine whether the file referenced in vercel.json or your configuration matches your actual file names/paths.
