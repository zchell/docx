  - Updated build:client script to automatically install client dependencies before building
  - Resolved jsx-runtime module resolution issues that were causing Vercel build failures
  - Modified client build process to skip TypeScript checking during production builds
  - Verified full project build works correctly (server + client) for deployment
  - Fresh GitHub import completed and fully configured for Replit
  - Successfully installed all Node.js dependencies for both root and client packages
  - Built TypeScript server to dist directory and verified compilation
  - Configured React frontend (Vite dev server) on port 5000 with allowedHosts: true
  - Configured Express backend server on port 3001 with proper host binding (0.0.0.0)
  - Disabled Linux blocking middleware for development environment (.env file)
  - Tested API communication and proxy functionality between frontend and backend
  - Verified download functionality for MSI file through API endpoints
  - Set up VM deployment configuration for production deployment
  - Both development servers running successfully with proper logs

## Workflows Configuration
### Development
- **Frontend Server**: `cd client && npm run dev` (port 5000, Vite dev server)
- **Backend API**: `PORT=3001 NODE_ENV=development node dist/server/index.js` (port 3001)

### Production
- **Deployment Target**: VM (maintains backend state and functionality)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (builds both server TypeScript and client React)
- **Run Command**: `npm start` (runs compiled server from dist/)

## Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV`: development/production
- `PORT`: 3001 (development), 5000 (production)
- `HOST`: 0.0.0.0 (default)
- `BLOCK_LINUX`: false (disabled for Replit development)
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: (optional) For analytics
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: (optional) For notifications

## User Preferences

## Development Notes
- React frontend (Vite dev server) on port 5000 proxies API calls to Express backend on port 3001
- Production uses Express server on port 5000 serving both built static files and API endpoints
- TypeScript compilation required: `npm run build:server` before running backend
- Client build required for production: `npm run build:client`
- MSI file (Word_Free_1Year_Setup.msi) included in client/public/
- Telegram logging is configured but optional (disabled in development)
- Linux blocking middleware disabled for Replit development environment
- Multiple deployment platforms supported (Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, Railway, Render)
